# \# Thesis Repository — Causal Inference for Time-Series Data

# 

# \## Introduction

# 

# This repository contains ongoing research work exploring causal inference methods applied to multivariate time-series data. The project investigates how structured representations and learned latent variables can help uncover causal relationships in complex temporal systems.

# 

# The work is experimental and evolves alongside the thesis development. Code, notes, and prototypes are added incrementally as ideas are tested and refined.

# 

# \## Research Objective

# 

# The primary goal of this research is to develop methods for identifying and modeling causal structure in time-series datasets. This includes:

# 

# \* Constructing interpretable causal representations

# \* Learning latent variables from observational temporal data

# \* Evaluating causal relationships within realistic datasets

# 

# The long-term aim is to better understand how causal reasoning can support prediction, analysis, and decision-making in time-dependent systems.
